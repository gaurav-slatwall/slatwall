	typography.css
	These styles control type styles on the front-end of a site as well as in the editor on the back-end,
	allowing consistent typographic display in both places and elimintaing the need to edit 2 stylesheets.

	If you prefer to have a single .css file (and not use this file),
	just comment out or remove the '@import url(typography.css);' line in style.css
	and add your type styles into your preferred stylesheet (usually 'site.css').
